#_From "Cognitive and social help-giving in online teaching"_

## Coginitive Help Giving Behaviors

* acknowledgement
* questioning
* direct instruction
* use of examples
* praise
* task structuring
* elaboration seeking
* pushing for exploration
* dialogue prompting

_p.170_

## Teacher immediacy, social presence, and teaching presence

Teacher presence is generally regarded as positive to student learning. There
are ways of closing the distance of 'presence' in online environments:

### Text based
* praise
* personal examples
* first names
* questioning
* humor
* digressions

### Video based
* gestures
* smiles
* relaxed posture
* movement around the classroom

> Student perception of 'social presence' is a strong predictor of satisfaction
> in online courses.

Students who experienced higher levels of social presence were more likely to
use emojis, and 'paralanguage' (hmm.., yuk) to help create immediacy in online
environment

_p.171_

In online classrooms social presence is mainly determined by teachers attitude
or the 'climate'.

## Academic help seeking

### Who do they ask?
* Formal help-seeking: from instructors
* Informal help-seeking: from peers, or family

### Why are they asking?
* Strategic help-seeking: looking for _how_ to solve the problem (focused on mastery)
* Expedient help-seeking: looking to use others to avoid work (getting the right
answer to a problem....Sinclair...focused on dependency)

Studies show that students are more likely to seek help in classrooms where:
* Rules and norms help promote strategic help seeking
* classroom goals are perceieved as mastery instead of performance-oriented
* students percieve as socially supportive

Teachers again play a big part in setting the tone in help seeking classrooms.
Teacher support of these behaviors impact teacher-student and student-student
help seeking behaviors.

#_From Effects of a Cooperative LearningProgram on the Elaborations of Students During Help Seeking and Help Giving_

In order for a student to seek strategic/instrumental/adaptive help, it must:
* reflect the student's awareness of a lack of understanding
* involve consideration of the necessity of the request, the content of the request, and the target of the request
* be expressed in a manner suit- able to the particularcircumstance
* involve processing of the help in such a manner that the possibility of success in subsequent help-seeking attempts is optimized

> Studies conducted by Newman (1994) and Newman and Schwager (1993) have shown
> that the decision to seek help is filtered through an affective-motivational
> system that includes help-seeking intentions, attitudes toward both the
> benefits and costs of help seeking, and achievement goals.

Achievement goals above refer to perceived performance oriented or mastery oriented
purpose of the course. People with a mastery oriented goals view help-seeking as
a natural part of the learning process. Performance oriented people are scared
questions/help-seeking shows low ability which they avoid. When this is the case
those in need of the most help are the ones who ask the fewest questions.

_p.118-19_

Helping others helps the help-giver better clarify their position and cement
their knowledge.

To be helpful, explanations/help must be:
* relevant
* timely
* clear

Students then must actually use the explanation to solve their problem.

> Students do not naturally develop constructive interactional patterns without
> instruction

Without proper instruction these are the problems you see with student help:
* students' explanations appear problematic and confused
* students provide few opportunities for the recipients of explanations to engage in constructive application of these explanations
* low-ability students are frequently omitted from group dynamics

> Constructive application of explanations is a strong predictor of achievement
> among the recipients of explanations.

Explicit instructions have been found to enhance students' group interactions by
teaching them how to:
* ask elaborated questions
* provide elaborated answers, arguments, and justifications

Students are more likely to obtain more elaborated help when they ask for it,
promoting this behavior is beneficial and requires instructions.

_p.119-20_

Fantastic breakdown of all the different help seeking and giving types of
quesitons, constructive interactions (and what they look like) and feedback
types. Good way to categorize help interactions -> _p.122_
