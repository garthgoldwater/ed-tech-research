## Teacher immediacy, social presence, and teaching presence

Teacher presence is generally regarded as positive to student learning. There
are ways of closing the distance of 'presence' in online environments:

### Text based
* praise
* personal examples
* first names
* questioning
* humor
* digressions

### Video based
* gestures
* smiles
* relaxed posture
* movement around the classroom

> Student perception of 'social presence' is a strong predictor of satisfaction
> in online courses.

Students who experienced higher levels of social presence were more likely to
use emojis, and 'paralanguage' (hmm.., yuk) to help create immediacy in online
environment

_p.171_

In online classrooms social presence is mainly determined by teachers attitude
or the 'climate'.

## Academic help seeking

### Who do they ask?
* Formal help-seeking: from instructors
* Informal help-seeking: from peers, or family

### Why are they asking?
* Strategic help-seeking: looking for _how_ to solve the problem
* Expedient help-seeking: looking to use others to avoid work (getting the right
answer to a problem....Sinclair)

Studies show that students are more likely to seek help in classrooms where:
* Rules and norms help promote strategic help seeking
* classroom goals are perceieved as mastery instead of performance-oriented
* students percieve as socially supportive

Teachers again play a big part in setting the tone in help seeking classrooms.
Teacher support of these behaviors impact teacher-student and student-student
help seeking behaviors.
