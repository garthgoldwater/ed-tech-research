# features and ideas

## guiding ideas
* univ. && higher-ed value diverse group formation. all research (and real life
 experience) shows that people tend to form groups with people similar to them.
 this is a solution for that issue IRL and online

## user story (roughly outlined)
1. sign up
2. 'enrolls' in courses
  * could be auto enrolled thru on-boarding w/ school
3. fills out profile with academic interests
4. enters approve/reject mode from button on dashboard
5. approves/rejects users in course
  * they will have access to a % match, academic interests, and perhaps location
   for each user
6. group(s) is/are created/chosen

## questions research needs to answer
* how are we determining % matches
  * looking for various group-formation models -> different models will help
   in dealing with issues like 'orphan students'
  * what 'kind' of people make good matches for what 'kinds' of groups
  * this is needed whether we form groups or people choose
* number of groups a person should be in (1-?)
* choosing your group is important; what counts as 'choosing'?
  * is approve/reject enough?
* the guidelines of positive group formation and maintenance
  * joining
  * leaving
  * kicking out


## ideas on what features could look like
* slack model of group formation: auto-enrolled in groups around your
 approval/rejection, location, and academic interests. you are free to form
 others
